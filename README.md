# Snake game

The game of Snake is a classic in video gaming, played on a rectangular board. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the board, and your goal is to make it eat small food objects to make it grow. The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail, as that would cause you to lose the game. As the snake grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to maneuver, requiring skill and strategy to achieve the highest possible score.
